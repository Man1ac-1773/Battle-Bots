# Battle Bots: Simultaneous Tic-Tac-Toe

Two bots choose a square **at the same time** on a 3×3 board. They cannot see each other's choice until the round is over. Build a single-file Python bot and try to predict, defend and adapt!

## Rules

Squares are numbered left to right, top to bottom:

```text
 0 | 1 | 2
---+---+---
 3 | 4 | 5
---+---+---
 6 | 7 | 8
```

1. Both bots receive the **same pre-round board** and independently choose **one square that is empty on that board**. Neither bot sees the other's current choice.
2. If the choices differ, put both marks down. If they match, the referee flips a **fair coin**: the winning bot claims that square and the other bot places nothing that round. The coin is flipped only for a collision.
3. After resolving the whole round, three of your marks in a row, column or diagonal wins. If **both** bots make a line in the same round, it is a draw. A full board without a sole winner is a draw.
4. An invalid action, crash or timeout forfeits the game to the other bot. If **both** bots fail in the same round, neither receives points for that game.

There is no first move: O and X are merely labels so the match log can show both choices. Each bot is given its own normalized view.

## Your bot

Submit a **single Python script** named `teamname_bot.py`. See [example-bot.py](example-bot.py), or start from any bot in `bot-tester/bots/`. Define a `Player` class with `act(gamestate)` and set `self.action = Action(i)` for an **integer** square `i` from `0` through `8` where `gamestate.pieces[i] == 0`. One new `Player` object is made **each round**, so do not rely on its fields to remember earlier rounds.

New to Python or classes? Read [PYTHON_BASICS.md](PYTHON_BASICS.md) first. You do **not** need `threading` or `super().__init__()` — the runner simply calls `run()`.

The smallest working bot looks like this:

```python
from Action import Action

class Player:
    def __init__(self, gamestate):
        self.gamestate = gamestate
        self.action = Action(-1)

    def run(self):
        self.act(self.gamestate)

    def act(self, gamestate):
        self.action = Action(gamestate.pieces.index(0))
```

It always picks the first free square. It is legal, but predictable and easy to beat.

| Bot-facing field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `gamestate.pieces` | Nine integers: `0` empty, `1` **your** mark, `2` the opponent's, regardless of whether the log calls you O or X. |
| `gamestate.round_number` | Number of completed rounds, beginning at `0`. |

Bot standard output is suppressed. The starter `example-bot.py` only builds its own lines and ignores the opponent, so it is intentionally beatable. Plain alternating-turn tic-tac-toe minimax does **not** model simultaneous choices or the referee's coin, so do not copy one in unchanged. [HINTS.md](HINTS.md) describes the stronger ideas (averaging over the opponent and the coin, then looking one round ahead) — we do not ship those bots, so building them is the challenge.

## Reference bots and hints

`bot-tester/bots/` contains a small ladder, easiest first. Play against them, beat them, then climb. Read [HINTS.md](HINTS.md) for the ideas behind each rung and how to go beyond them. The stronger bots are **not** shipped — discovering those ideas is the challenge.

| Bot | Idea | Its weakness |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `random-bot.py` | pick any empty square | no plan at all |
| `first-empty-bot.py` | always the lowest empty square | completely predictable |
| `greedy-bot.py` | build your own lines, ignore the opponent | no defence |
| `win-block-bot.py` | win if you can, else collide with their winning square | a collision is only a 50/50 coin |

## Test locally

Install **Python 3** and put your file in `bot-tester/bots/`. From the repository's top directory, run:

```sh
python3 bot-tester/validate.py bot-tester/bots/teamname_bot.py
python3 bot-tester/main.py --paired-rounds 2 --seed demo
```

On Windows, use `python` or `py` if `python3` is not available. **Validate** checks six board positions and two full games; passing is not a guarantee that every possible board is handled. **Simulate** plays everyone in the bots folder; `--paired-rounds 2` is a quick local run. Use `--seed demo` only to reproduce **local** matches; the official referee generates its own private seed. A bot that deliberately reseeds itself can still behave differently on another run. To check a **local** saved result, run `python3 bot-tester/verify_results.py bot-tester/tournament-results.json --allow-embedded-seed`. That checks consistency, not who created the log; an official log needs a separately supplied seed and signature for authentication.

By default a local tournament uses **10 paired seed rounds: 20 games per pair**, swapping O/X labels each pair of games. **The two seat orders get different coin and bot-random streams**; their outcomes are not copies. Each bot has a **hard 2.5-second wall-clock limit per choice**, including process startup; a bot still running after the deadline forfeits that game. You can test a different limit with `--timeout SECONDS`. Results are saved in `bot-tester/tournament-results.json`. The official judge uses an explicit hashed roster rather than this local tester's bot folder.

The local tester runs files in `bot-tester/bots/` as ordinary Python processes with **your account's permissions**. Run only scripts you trust on your own computer. It is not the official judge. For the official event, organizers use isolated bot processes, an explicit hashed submission roster and a private random seed generated inside the referee. Official results are signed and audited separately from this local tester. A locally saved JSON log by itself is not proof of an official result; after judging, the organizer can release the seed, original signature and verification key for `verify_results.py`.

## Submission: code **and** strategy PDF

Send **both** your Python bot (one `.py` file) and a strategy PDF through the submission form (see **Submission details** below). Name the file whatever you like — `teamname_bot.py` is just a placeholder. Humour us. (Extra points, maybe. idk.)

In the PDF, in your own words, explain:

- How your bot chooses a square, including what it assumes about the other bot and how it treats collisions/coin outcomes.
- Which ideas you tried, what changed while testing, and at least one weakness or edge case you noticed.
- How you tested it (for example, both O/X labels, different opponents, or repeatable seeds). A couple of lines is enough; fancy diagrams and advanced algorithms are not required.

AI coding assistance is allowed. We evaluate the behavior, the code and your ability to explain the decisions—not a guess about whether you used an AI tool.
The sample bots use only the Python standard library; no third-party package is guaranteed on the judging machine. Your script must be self-contained apart from the provided `Action` and `GameState` modules.

## Judging

**Performance (primary).** Each game awards 1 for a win, 0.5 for a draw, and 0 for a loss; a double forfeit gives 0 to both. Every entrant plays every other entrant for the same number of paired games (both O and X). Your **performance** is your average points per game.

**Ranking is banded.** Because the coin adds luck, two bots whose performances differ by less than the tournament's statistical noise band are treated as **tied on performance**. The band shrinks as more games are played. A bot in a strictly better band always outranks one in a worse band, so nothing below can overtake a clearly stronger bot.

**Secondary benchmark (private experts).** Every submission also plays a private set of internal reference bots that span a wide range of strategies, from naive to strong. This is a **secondary performance metric**: it is used only to order bots that are already tied on the entrant round robin, before any subjective scoring. The reference bots and the raw benchmark scores are not published, so that submissions are judged on general strength rather than on how well they match one specific opponent.

**Quality (0–20), used to order bots within a performance band after the expert benchmark.** Same rubric for everyone:

| Criterion | Points | What we look for |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| General strategy | 0–6 | Works across different boards and opponents; reasoning rather than a large unexplained board-to-move lookup. |
| Reasoning | 0–6 | PDF explains choices, opponent uncertainty, collisions and tradeoffs; matches what the code does. |
| Testing and iteration | 0–4 | Evidence of trying different situations, learning from failures and checking edge cases. |
| Clarity and robustness | 0–4 | Understandable code and reliable decisions within the announced limits. |

Remaining ties (same band and quality): head-to-head points, then wins, then fewest forfeits, then a shared rank. The organizer records the quality subscores and brief reasons, and publishes results and match logs. A short strategy walkthrough may be requested to clarify a submission; eloquence and code length are not scoring criteria.
